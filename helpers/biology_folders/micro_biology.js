The sheets do not break easily but can slide across each other\n\tDiamond: Another form of carbon, has a rigid crystal lattice and is one of the strongest and hardest materials on Earth.

Nanotubes are sheets of carbon rolled into hollow tubes and they are very strong and conduct electr­icity and are used in miniature electrical circuits."
